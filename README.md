## Project Overview

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features Implemented
- Updated hover states to enhance user interactivity.
- Implemented form validations to ensure valid user inputs when submitting the form.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the page layout and appearance.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for form validation and interactivity.

## Challenges Faced
During the assessment, I faced challenges in adjusting the size of texts and forms to match the design provided in Figma. To overcome these challenges, I conducted thorough research to find suitable solutions and best practices. I explored various techniques such as using relative units like media queries, setting appropriate font sizes and line heights, and applying CSS styles to achieve the desired visual appearance. Through research and experimentation, I was able to align the size of texts and forms with the Figma design, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout.

## Future Improvements
I could implement more visually appealing and user-friendly error messages within the form or providing feedback through a notification system for the future.
